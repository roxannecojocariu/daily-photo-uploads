A basic rails app that lets users create an account and post/upload only a single picture per day.

Ruby Version - 2.3.3

A user must sign up or sign in, in order to have full access to the app.
A user can submit a photo for the day by filling out a form which requires a photo and description is optional.
A user can view their submitted photo for the day or for any days they submitted a photo.

For testing, I used Rspec and Capybara.
